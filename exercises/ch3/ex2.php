// #arrays, #loops

// Create arrays:
$family = []; // contains the names of all your family members
$memberHeight = []; // associative array that maps the family member name to his/her height in cm (ex. 'Andrey' => 180)

/* Then do the following:
 *  1. var_dump all arrays
 *  2. using all variants of php loops (while, for, foreach) print all family info in the following format: 'Member Andrey is 180 tall'
